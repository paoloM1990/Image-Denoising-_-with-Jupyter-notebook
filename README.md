# Image-Denoising-_-with-Jupyter-notebook
This repository contains my favourite examples of Image Denoising for microscopy/biology images by using Python and in particular Jupyter notebook. 

Full credit goes to Dr. Sreenivas Bhattiprolu, who created these examples in the first place. You can find his .py files at https://github.com/bnsreenu/python_for_microscopists. 

This repository is just a selection of my favourite denoising algorithms illustrated by Dr. Bhattiprolu. 
I provide the following items in this folder: 
- Jupyter notebook files
- original images to upload
- PDF previews 
- installation guidelines of Jupyter notebook (via Anaconda installation) 

Any person can have fun using these algorithms, even without any previous basic knowledge in Python. 

For any beginners in the audience, I would suggest to watch some video tutorials by Dr. Bhattiprolu. 
These are designed to train absolute beginners on Python coding with a special emphasis on image analysis. 
The link to these video tutorials is the following:
