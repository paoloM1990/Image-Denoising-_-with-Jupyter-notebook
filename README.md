# Image-Denoising-_-with-Jupyter-notebook
This repository contains my favourite examples of Image Denoising for microscopy/biology images by using Python and in particular Jupyter notebook. Full credit goes to Dr. Sreenivas Bhattiprolu, who created this examples in the first place; you can find his .py files at https://github.com/bnsreenu/python_for_microscopists. This repository is just a selection of my favourite denoising algorithms illustrated by Dr. Bhattiprolu. I provide Jupyter notebook files, original images to upload and PDF previews so that any person can have fun using these algorithms. Installation guidelines of Jupyter notebook (via Anaconda installation) are also provided.
